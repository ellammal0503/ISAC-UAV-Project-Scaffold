# AI Models

Implemented in `src/models/`.

## Baselines
- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- CNN (1D Convolutional Neural Network)
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Transformer (Sequence modeling)

## Deep Learning
- CNNs on extracted feature vectors
- RNNs and Transformers for sequence modeling

## Training
- Supervised learning with synthetic dataset
- Loss function: Cross-Entropy for classification
- Metrics: Accuracy

## Output
- LOS/NLOS classification
- Model checkpoints saved in `results/models/`
